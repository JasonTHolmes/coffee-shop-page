        <h2 class="lg-paragraph-intro">Family owned and operated since 1987</h2>
        <p class="lg-paragraph">
            Since first opening our doors in 1987, Joe's Cafe has been owned and operated by the smith family. When Papa Joe was unable to operate the business, it was past down to Junior, who at the time was the head barista and in charge of placing the orders for the pastries. That was in 1997. That was 25 years ago, and we still stand by our promise of being an honest, family owned establishment dedicated to providing a positive place, and having a positive impact on our community. We hope we provide that for you and that you are as satisfied with us as we are happy to serve you.

            <p class="sm-paragraph">
                As mentioned above, there's nothing more important than family. This is why Joe's makes sure that we provide adequate seating for everyone, including the little ones. Joe's has been and will always be welcoming to families.

                Coffee, the good old pick me upper. Joe's understands the necessity for value. We understand it and we ignore it. Here at Joe's we have made handshake agreements with our local American Farmers to ensure that we exclusively get our beans direct from our farmers.
